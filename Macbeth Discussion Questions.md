The Renaissance (14th – 16th Centuries) was one of the richest cultural periods in Western history, and the works of Shakespeare are a product of that period and the Elizabethan Age (during the reign of Elizabeth I, 1532-1603). In order to understand the beauty and sophistication of the entire period, we will explore not only this wonderful play but also the other cultural riches of the Renaissance. We will be looking at some art from the Renaissance and listening to music from the period; however, combine this with our study of Shakespeare (during which we will watch portions of two versions of the play’s performance) and the historical context of both his time and the time in which the play is set, and we will have a more complete picture of the Renaissance and the time of Elizabeth.
 
 
***Discussion Questions for the Acts –You MAY NOT use any outside sources as you answer the questions for the play, only what I give you in class.***
 
## Act I
 
 1) Shakespeare opens the play with the witches conversing on the heath.  What atmosphere and tone are created in this short opening scene?  How does the line, “Fair is foul, and foul is fair,” later echoed in Scene 3, foreshadow the events of the entire act?
 1) We first hear about Macbeth in Scene 2, through the speeches of the wounded sergeant as he reports to Duncan.  What initial impression are we given of Macbeth (look closely at what the soldier says)?  In what ways is this impression confirmed in Scene 3?  In what ways is it not confirmed?
 1) Macbeth and Banquo react differently to the witches and their predictions.  Compare their reactions.  How does the presence of Banquo in this act help create a sharper impression of Macbeth?  In what ways is Banquo “lesser than Macbeth, and greater”?
 1) Is there any evidence in this act that Macbeth had previously entertained the possibility of becoming king?  If so, what does this indicate about the role of witches play in influencing Macbeth’s thoughts and actions?
 1) What are Lady Macbeth’s reactions when she receives Macbeth’s letter in Scene 5?  How do her reactions compare with those of Macbeth earlier, when he hears the witches’ prophecies and when he learns he has been made thane of Cawdor?  What impression do you form of her character in the remaining scenes of this act?
 1) Study carefully Macbeth’s soliloquy at the beginning of Scene 7:  “If it were done when tis done, then ‘twere well / It were done quickly.”  What do we learn about Macbeth’s state of mind from this speech?  What is his conflict?  How does he describe Duncan’s character?  What is the effect of Lady Macbeth’s arguments?
 1) Shakespeare ends Act I with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth plotting the murder of Duncan.  How exactly do they plan to kill him?  What is the dramatic effect of concluding the act by letting us see the murder plot as it crystallizes?
 
## Act II
 
 1) An atmosphere of foreboding and horror is built up in Act II.  Much of the horror is implicit in Macbeth’s famous “dagger” soliloquy in Scene 1.  Why does Macbeth refer to the dagger as a “fatal vision”?  What does he mean by a “dagger of the mind”?  What is suggested by having Macbeth experience a hallucination at this moment, just before the murder?
 1) In Scene 2, after the murder of Duncan, Macbeth is troubled by voices he heard or thought he heard.  Why could he not say “Amen” when a voice said, “God bless us!”?  What is meant by “Macbeth does murder sleep”?  Why won’t Macbeth return to Duncan’s room?  How, on the other hand, does Lady Macbeth characterize the dead?
 1) The symbols of blood and water are interwoven in several lines in Scene 2.  What does each symbolize?  How do the different attitudes of Macbeth and his wife to their bloodstained hands serve to point up the basic difference in their characters?
 1) The Porter’s speech as he answers the knocking at the gate at the beginning of Scene 3 is one of the best known examples in all Shakespeare of what is called “comic relief.”  Judging from this scene, what do you think is relieved by the Porter’s comic speech?  What elements or images in the speech provide an extension of, rather than a contrast to, the atmosphere of the preceding scene?
 1) The murder of Duncan provokes different thoughts and reactions in Macbeth’s guests.  After carefully rereading the lines in Scene 3 that describe the private thoughts of Banquo and Malcolm, discuss what you think they are saying.  What do we learn of importance from these responses?
 1) In Scene 4 there are several examples of dramatic irony in which situations are the tragic reverse of what the participants think.  What is ironic about Macduff’s replying to Ross’s question “Those that Macbeth hath slain”?  What is ironic about Macduff’s suspicion of Duncan’s two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain?
 1) What examples are there throughout Act II of the effect upon nature of human deeds?  In Scene 4 alone, what three strange and unnatural events are described that would instill the superstitious Elizabethan audience with a sense of foreboding?
 
## Act III
 
 1) In the opening speech of Act III, Banquo muses on the witches’ prophecies.  Which have come true?  Which give Banquo hope for the future?  Why has Banquo remained silent when he believes that Macbeth has played “most foully”?
 1) In the opening conversations of Scene 1, there are several examples of dramatic irony.  Pick out four separate instances and explain the irony of each.
 1) How do scenes 1 and 2 reveal a moral change in Macbeth?  There is also a change in the relationship between Macbeth and his wife.  What is the change and where is it most apparent?  What does it reveal about Macbeth’s moral state?
 1) One of the great puzzles of the play is the appearance of the third murderer in Scene 3.  Some authorities feel it is a messenger from Macbeth; some feel it is Macbeth himself; some feel it is a person who, either from friendship to Banquo’s cause or at the witches’ instigation, joins the murderers to assure Fleance’s escape.  Select one of these theories, or invent one of your own, and be ready to defend it.
 1) In the banquet scene (Scene 4), what speeches by Macbeth seem to call forth Banquo’s ghost?  What is ironic about this timing?  How does Lady Macbeth act to save Macbeth?
 1) By the time of the banquet scene, Macbeth has taken the two major steps necessary for the achievement of his goal.  This action and the simultaneous increase of tension are known technically as the rising action of the play.  Rising action builds toward a climax, the dramatic highpoint, or point of greatest tension in the play.  All action after the climax is referred to as the falling action, or resolution, of the play.  Reread the banquet scene (Scene 4).  Why do you think it is considered by many to be the climax, or turning point, of Macbeth?
 
## Act IV
 
 1) Hecate and the witches call up four separate apparitions for Macbeth.  What are they?  Why is Macbeth oblivious to the hidden meanings in the witches’ prophecies?  What occurrence in this scene deeply disturbs him?  Why does the last king carry a looking glass?
 1) Why does Macbeth decide to murder Macduff’s family?  How does this decision differ from his decisions to murder Duncan and Banquo?  What does this indicate about the development of Macbeth’s character?
 1) Reread the conversation in Scene 2 between Lady Macduff and her son.  What is Lady Macduff like?  What is her son like?  How does this lively, intimate exchange affect our response to the brutal killing with which this scene ends?
 1) In Scene 3, how does Malcolm describe himself to Macduff?  Why does he misrepresent his character to Macduff?  What aspects of his character here suggest that he will be a strong leader of the Scottish patriotic forces against Macbeth?
 1) Shakespeare’s handling of the intensely emotional scene when Ross tells Macduff of the murder of his wife and children is particularly masterful.  How does Ross’s behavior here build up the intensity of the moment?  What does Malcolm say to try to help Macduff control his grief and redirect his emotions?
 
## Act V
 
 1) In Scene 1, the famous “sleepwalking scene,” Lady Macbeth relives events that have taken place earlier in the play.  In her ravings she skips from one event to another but she always returns to the same one.  Of the three events she broods over, which troubles her most deeply?  Why?  Why is Lady Macbeth obsessed with the idea of washing her hands?
 1) In Scene 3, reread the six lines beginning with “I have lived long enough.”  What does this soliloquy tell us about Macbeth’s state of mind on the eve of battle?  What traditional comforts of old age does he realize will not be his?
 1) Macbeth’s final word on the meaning of life is given in Scene 5 (about lines 20-30).  How would you describe, in one word, the tone of this soliloquy?  What are Macbeth’s thoughts on life as expressed in the early lines of this passage?  What specifically is the “brief candle” and what is its connection to “a poor player”?  Why is it significant that this speech was written for an actor?
 1) Macbeth is a brave soldier almost to the end.  On what occasions in Act V does he express his courage?  Where does his courage momentarily fail him?  Macbeth is sometimes cited as an example of “the villain as hero.”  Do you agree?  Explain your answer.
 1) The play concludes with a public oration by Malcolm, who is about to be crowned King of Scotland.  What aspects of this speech make it an appropriate conclusion?  Do we learn anything new in the speech?
 1) Tragedy moves an audience to sympathy.  If Macbeth were nothing but the story of an evil man and his violent crimes, it would not have the power to move us as it does.  The central figure of the play is a tragic hero—a man of imagination and courage, with a fatal weakness, or tragic flaw, in his character (as we saw with Oedipus).  What is that flaw and how does it destroy him?  Does Lady Macbeth share this flaw?
 
Questions on the play as a whole (the entire class will tackle these—Do NOT answer these with your partner)
 
Although Macbeth and Lady Macbeth possess a number of the same character traits, they also reveal many dissimilarities of character.  Referring to specific lines or incidents throughout the play, compare and contrast the characters of Macbeth and his wife.
Analyze the character of one of the leading figures in Macbeth and show, by reference to specific lines in the play, the means whereby this person’s character is revealed; through the reactions of others, through the person’s own actions or conversations, or through soliloquies.
While the speeches of both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are written in blank verse, the poetic language in which they express their thoughts and feelings is quite different.  Quoting passages from the play, analyze and compare the language used by Macbeth and his wife.  How does Shakespeare individualize his characters through their language?
A frequent subject of debate is the question of just how much control the witches had over Macbeth’s free will and his destiny.  Present your own opinions on this argument, supporting your viewpoint with references to the play.
Compare and contrast the two film versions we have been watching and point out some of the more significant differences between them.
