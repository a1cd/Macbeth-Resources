### Social Media and Lady Macbeth 
> Can you sympathize with lady macbeth?

I think Lady Macbeth chooses to aid Macbeth in killing the king when she [asks the spirits to fill her veins](./The%20Tragedy%20of%20Macbeth.md#lady-macbeth-2). She is no longer able to turn back. This is like how today, people have an easier time saying things online that they would not say in person.



When Macbeth decides to kill Macduff's family, he does it on a whim! In contrast, he takes days to kill Ducan and deliberates it for a long time.
