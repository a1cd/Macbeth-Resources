### Social Media and Lady Macbeth 
> Can you sympathize with lady macbeth?

I think Lady Macbeth chooses to aid Macbeth in killing the king when she [asks the spirits to fill her veins][fillwithspirits]. She is no longer able to turn back. This is like how today, people have an easier time saying things online that they would not say in person.
